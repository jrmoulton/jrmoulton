# Hey! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jrmoulton/jrmoulton/master/images/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Jared Moulton and I'm an ECE student and computer enthusiast. I get excited about building things that help people. 

# üìö School and Education

I am currently a computer engineering student at Utah State University. The major specific classes that I have taken till this point are:
- ECE 1400 - Programming in C
- ECE 1410 - Programming in C++ and learning basic principles of OOP
- ECE 2700 - Digital Circuits - Circuit design and theory with Verilog (building CPUs and such)
- ECE 2250 - Electrical Circuits - Theory, practice and design of electrical circuits with TSPice

# üåê Langages
My language of choice is Rust because, for me, it is most often the tool suited to any job. But when it makes sense to use another language, I am comfortable in several. Rust and Python are my most productive langauges and I am comforable with all C *and* C++ syntax but not necessarily production code. I have worked with Swift but not Xcode and I am learning Java. I am also fluent in Spanish

The six projects pinned below show a variety of the projects that I have worked on.  
Several other to look at would be:

My profile is currently intended to give a high level overview of the
different projects that I have worked on and what I learned from each of those
projects
