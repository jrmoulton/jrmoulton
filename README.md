# Hey! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jrmoulton/jrmoulton/master/images/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Jared Moulton and I'm an ECE student and computer enthusiast. I get excited about building things that help people. 

# üìö School and Education

I am currently a computer engineering student at Utah State University. The major specific classes that I have taken till this point are:
- ECE 1400 - Programming in C
- ECE 1410 - Programming in C++ and learning basic principles of OOP
- ECE 2700 - Digital Circuits - Circuit design and theory with Verilog (building CPUs and such)
- ECE 2250 - Electrical Circuits - Theory, practice and design of electrical circuits with LTSPice
- These are the classes that I have taken but most of my knowledge and skill comes from my own initiative and learning outside of class

# üåê Langages
My language of choice is Rust but I am comfortable with several languages. I am most productive in rust and python and I am comforable with C *and* C++. I have worked with Swift but not Xcode and I am learning Java. I'm also fluent in Spanish
