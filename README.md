Hey I'm Jared! I'm a computer engineering student and I get excited about building things that help people

## üìö School and Education

I am a computer engineering student at Utah State University. The major classes I have taken are:
- ECE 1400 - Programming in C
- ECE 1410 - Programming in C++
- ECE 2700 - Digital Circuits
- ECE 2250 - Electrical Circuits
- ECE 3700 - Digital System Design
- CS 2420 - Algorithms and Data Structures

Most of my time learing is spent on side projects outside of class

## üåê Langages
My language of choice is **Rust**. I also work in **C++** and I am comfortable with **C** and **Python**. I would prefer to not use my **Java** skills and I'm also fluent in Spanish

## üìå Best Work

My latest and best work includes the [DACx0501](https://github.com/jrmoulton/dacx0501) library, [Tmux Sessionizer](https://github.com/jrmoulton/tmux-sessionizer) and my work on [esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal).
